# digraphs

You might be interested in these repositories as well:

 * [alb-i/cuda_digraphs](https://github.com/alb-i/cuda_digraphs) -- finding paths in digraphs using a gpu through CUDA on windows, might be a little bit of a struggle to make it compile though; abandoned.
 * [alb-i/sage-gammoid-dump](https://github.com/alb-i/sage-gammoid-dump) -- old [sage](https://sagemath.org) code mainly revolving around gammoids, thus including code for determining routings in digraphs, does not work with recent python3-based sage versions (8.6 with python2 works); abandoned.
 * [alb-i/spark-gammoids](https://github.com/alb-i/spark-gammoids) -- gammoid library for scala and spark, contains code for dealing with paths in digraphs locally (plain scala) and on a spark-cluster; currently active (at time of writing).


## GPU combinatorics

This is the place where I would like to research vectorization approaches for combinatorial tasks, so that I may utilize the vast parallelism of GPUs for combinatorial tasks such as enumerating all paths in a digraph.
